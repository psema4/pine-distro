## Synopsis

*pine-distro* is a tweaked version of the official Raspbian image from http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads and comes in the form of an image file.

Download the latest image with a bittorrent client: http://pinegames.org/public/pine-autoboot_2013-07-08.img.bz.torrent

Once downloaded, extract the image:

    tar -xjf pine-autoboot_2013-07-08.img.bz


Burn the resulting .img file to a 4GB SD card (see http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup if you need help)

Finally, insert the SD Card into your Raspberry Pi Model B and turn it into an HTML5 Gaming Console!
